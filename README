1. Installation
===============

*NOTE* If you are installing from a git clone, see README-git.

The following dependencies are required to build a2ps:

  - BDW GC (libgc): https://www.hboehm.info/gc
  - libpaper: https://github.com/rrthomas/libpaper

The following dependencies are highly recommended:

  - psutils: https://github.com/rrthomas/psutils
  - GNU roff: https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/

Most of the work for the installation is done by ./configure.  If you
never ever read the file `INSTALL', then you really should do it
*now*.

Some key options for ./configure are:

    --disable-nls
    	if you do not want to use Native Language Support
    	(i.e. the ability to speak another tongue than English)
    --with-gnu-gettext
    	if you want to use the GNU gettext library for
    	NLS, instead of available NLS services.  I recommend it.
    --without-extensions
    	Fewer files will get installed.  a2ps is still usable
    	for Western Europe and American.  You should avoid unless
    	you are really short on disk.  This does not imply
    	--disable-nls, you have to add it yourself.

The following choices *are not irreversible*.  They just correspond to
settings in the file etc/a2ps-site.cfg:

    --with-encoding=ENCODING
    	define the default encoding (ascii, latin1..., latin6,
    	hp, mac, ibmpc, pcg, cp1250).

Note (for novices). If you are not root, you should give
./configure the option --prefix=$HOME to be able to install.

Remember that `make install' is mandatory for a2ps to work correctly.
Once the `make install' is done, you may remove the build directory (the
one which has been extracted from the .gz, which you can also remove,
BTW).
