1. Installation
===============

Some notes on the distribution:

Most of the work for the installation is done by ./configure.  If you
never ever read the file `INSTALL', then you really should do it
*now*.

Some choices are to make, and to give to ./configure

    --disable-nls
    	if you do not want to use Native Language Support
    	(i.e. the ability to speak another tongue than English)
    --with-gnu-gettext
    	if you want to use the GNU gettext library for
    	NLS, instead of available NLS services.  I recommend it.
    --without-extensions
    	Fewer files will get installed.  a2ps is still usable
    	for Western Europe and American.  You should avoid unless
    	you are really short on disk.  This does not imply
    	--disable-nls, you have to add it yourself.

The following choices *are not irreversible*.  They just correspond to
settings in the file etc/a2ps-site.cfg:

    --with-encoding=ENCODING
    	define the default encoding (ascii, latin1..., latin6,
    	hp, mac, ibmpc, pcg, cp1250).

Note (for novices). If you are not root, you should give
./configure the option --prefix=$HOME to be able to install.

There are several things a2ps needs to know about your system in
order to work properly.  Running configure should be enough to have
apropriate values, nevertheless, it sure is better if you good check
the following items:

1. At the end of etc/a2ps_cfg, the lines
  a. FileCommand:
  b. Variable: lp.default
  c. Variable: lp

2. At the top of etc/a2ps-site.cfg, the lines
  a. Options: --encoding=
  b. Options: --medium=

There are some architectures, typically Solaris, that will fail saying
that symbols `bindtextdomain' etc. are missing.  Then re-configure but
specifying --with-included-gettext.

Remember that \`make install' is mandatory for a2ps to work correctly.
Once the \`make install' done, you may remove the build directory (the
one which has been extracted from the .gz, which you can also removed,
BTW).

If you encounter problems while configuring or running, it is likely
that somebody already fell on the same problems.  Hence please read

     http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps/

which lists the known problems, and the fixes.  Check out also for the
FAQ, and for a newer version of a2ps: don't send me reports for
prehistoric versions!

If the trouble persists, then, indeed, you may wish to send a bug
report (i.e. something *precise* about the problem and your
configuration :-) to

	mailto:bug-a2ps@gnu.org

Do not, *ever*, send bug reports to a2ps@gnu.org.  Well, pleeeeeease,
I mean.
