These notes intend to help people working on the git version of a2ps.
Only the sources are installed in the git repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore as well as the dependencies listed in
README under "Installation" you will need the maintainer tools we depend
upon:

  - Automake
  - Autoconf
  - Gettext
  - Libtool
  - Gperf

* First git checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
a2ps from git.  For the records, you will find all the relevant
information on:

	https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=a2ps

The next step is to install the generated files:

	$ ./bootstrap

This should not change any files from git except maybe the date in po/*.po
files.

Enjoy!
